description: 'The planet Wolf: a deadly world under a cold red sun, old when Terrans
  were learning to walk upright. Only one Terran agent knew Wolf well enough to pass
  undetected, but he had ruined his usefulness long ago. Now, only this scarred and
  bitter man can discover the secret of The Door Through Space.'
